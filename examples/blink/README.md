This example will blink an LED connected to pin 0 of the Milk-V Duo using the
wiringX library. Note that the pinout when using wiringX is not the same as the
default pinout of the Milk-V Duo

The correct pinout to use for this library is given (on this
page)[https://milkv.io/docs/duo/application-development/wiringx]

This pinout numbering matches that of the Raspberry Pi Pico
